# multi_forms

In this project, I built 4 progress steps. These steps could be used as multi-level forms, such as a shopping cart that starts at "1" (e.g. the user adding an item to their cart) and progresses to "4" (e.g. secure checkout and payment). The buttons control the steps. When the user selects "next", the line progresses from "1" to "2", and the "2" border lights up as the progress bar line becomes filled.
